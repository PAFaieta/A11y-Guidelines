# A11y-Guidelines

I'm starting this to help kickstart a personal effort to document guidelines for businesses that more easily encapsulate what WCAG is aiming to do, but also add in my own inputs if/when they're relevant. This project is not meant to be completed either. These ideas will mainly be sourced through the WCAG, so credit belongs to them for the most part because without that, something like this would not exist. Should you have any suggestions, please feel free to add an issue and it will be reviewed.

Please also note that some of the suggestions will be from the perspective of my background as a front-end developer. As a general note, I will be abiding by ARIA Rules for not re-purposing elements quite strictly. I feel that it provides the easiest and cleanest approach overall.

The aim here will be to create more of a Wiki/Documentation style setup. Should you feel the need to source some of the ideas, please attribute those citations properly.
